				<p>When I enrolled at the University of Rochester, I had planned on pursuing a Financial Economics major. As a result, I have a lot of economics and finance courses under my belt. I am taking Finance, Economics, Computer Science and Dance courses this semester. Dance is by far my most favorite as it helps me become more aware of my body and experiment with flow and movement. My economics course taught by Professor Rizzo is interesting in that it doesnâ€™t fit the general description of an economics course. Professor Rizzo believes in applying meta-principles in everyday life to help us better evaluate cost/benefit decisions. All in all, my course load this semester is both exciting and challenging and covers both mental and physical aspects of human learning. Spring of 18 feels good, so far!</p>


				<h2>Hometown Info</h2>

				<p>I was born in Srinagar, in the Indian administered part of Jammu and Kashmir state. It is located in Srinagar District, which is in the northwestern part of Jammu and Kashmir state, close to the Pakistani-Indian border. The population was 1,273,312, according to the 2011 Census. The city is estimated to have been founded in the 6th Century AD. The city is governed by Srinagar Municipal Corporation, which is essentially an elected body of councillors.
