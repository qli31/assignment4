					<h2>About Me</h2>

					<p>Hello! My name is Irfan Bashir. I am a
						<em>sophomore</em> and an international student from Indian attending the University of Rochester and my major is Financial
						Economics.</p>

					<h2>Work Experience</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>co-founder of the Federation for Peace and Development (FPD), which my partners and I founded in December 2016</li>
						<li>special correspondent, reporter, and editor with The Kashmir Scan since June 2009</li>


					</ul>



					<h2>Course Work</h2>
					<h3>"Not that busy as for now. Love to dance. Still get time for it!"</h3>
					<p>When I enrolled at the University of Rochester, I had planned on pursuing a Financial Economics major. All in all, my
						course load this semester is both exciting and challenging and covers both mental and physical aspects of human learning.
						I would love to spend more time on dancing in this sememster.Spring of 18 feels good, so far! When I enrolled at the
						University of Rochester, I had planned on pursuing a Financial Economics major. As a result, I have a lot of economics
						and finance courses under my belt. I am taking Finance, Economics, Computer Science and Dance courses this semester.
						Dance is by far my most favorite as it helps me become more aware of my body and experiment with flow and movement.
						My economics course taught by Professor Rizzo is interesting in that it doesnâ€™t fit the general description of an economics
						course. Professor Rizzo believes in applying meta-principles in everyday life to help us better evaluate cost/benefit
						decisions. All in all, my course load this semester is both exciting and challenging and covers both mental and physical
						aspects of human learning. Spring of 18 feels good, so far!</p>
