				<h3>Not that busy as for now. Love to dance!</h3>

				<p>When I enrolled at the University of Rochester, I had planned on pursuing a Financial Economics major. My economics course taught by Professor Rizzo is interesting in that it doesnâ€™t fit the general description of an economics course. All in all, my course load this semester is exciting and covers both mental and physical aspects of human learning. I will be able to know something new but also have more time to dance. Spring of 18 feels good, so far!</p>
