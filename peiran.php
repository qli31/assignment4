					<h3>"So much work need to take care!"</h3>

					<p>When I enrolled at the University of Rochester, I had planned to pursue a Financial Economics and Data science major.Both
						of the major are really intriging but also it is a lot of work to cover. I am currently taking CSC 265 this sememster.
						Most of the semester I am overload but I really enjoy this experience. I plan to take fours courses in my last sememster
						and in the mean time prepare for my GRE. I need to finish my application as soon as possible. It is a lot of work to take care. I will surely take a long vocation after my application.</p>
