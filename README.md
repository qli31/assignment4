### ontology, choregraphy and taxonomy for the website:

The website will cover 4 students. The focus of the webpage will be the work experience and course work for each of the students. All 4 students are currently study in University of Rochester. Among four students, the first three students are sophmore \and fourth student are junior. 

The website shows the difference between sophmore and senior. Compare to sophmore, the senior student has more work experience and more course work. Workload related pictures should be next to the course work sections to help the readers related to ligher course work for sophmore and heavier course work for senior. The first three students will have similar picture about light course work and the forth student will have a picture indicate heavy course work. The work experience part will be presented in list rather than a paragraph. With a obvious longer list on the forth students, the readers can easily sense that the senior have more work experience.


### layout

For introduction page: The page will have a short introduction for four students and point out the difference between the first three and the forth clearly. This paragraph will have larger font and good padding, so that it easily catch the reader's sight and help the reader to get the main focus of the website. After the introduction section, there are short paragraphs for each students. The first three students will have the same background color and font and border. The forth one will have different kind of background color, font and border. The JS slider should have the pictures of all four students. If the coder is capable of adding a frame for the pictures in the slider, it is recommended for the designer to have contrast frame color for the forth student. It is recommended to high light or use contrast color for the words "sophmore" and "senior" to help the user better understand the different we are focuing here.

For individual page: The work experience, coursework and the picture for coursework will be on the left side and take around 70% of the space. The picture for the individual will be on the right side. The pictures should be in the same size and in scale. The heading and the navigation bar should be in the center and have the same width as the body part. The about me, coursework and work experience are headers as that is the ontogoly for this website.

In general, all the page should have nevigation bars. The coder should make sure the navigation bar work properly. It is recommended for the designer to have a contrast color for the forth student in the nevigation bar. The nevigation bar should have links to all the pages except the thank you page(post_survey.php). All the pages should have idencial footer and similar design(but show contrast in the forth student webpage).

### suggestion for fonts

Details for fonts are mentioned above, in general the first students will have the same kind of fonts and the forth will have different kind of fonts. The fonts can be causual but not too funny. To better show the contradiction between the first three and the forth. On the introduction page, it is better the high light the keyword, like "prefer outdoor activities" or "have a lot of coursework".

### web form basic info and attibute

The web form should gather the users information about their coursework and work experience during their sophmore year or senior year, which are sharing the same focus of the website.
