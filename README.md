### ontology, choregraphy and taxonomy for the website:

The website will cover 4 students. The focus of the webpage will be the work experience, course work and extracurricular activitis for each of the students. All 4 students are currently study in University of Rochester. Among four students, the first three students are sophmore and enjoy indoor activies and fourth student are junior and enjoy outdoor activities.

Difference between sophmore and senior. Compare to sophmore, the senior student has more work experience and more course work. Pictures will be next to the course work sections to help the readers related to ligher course work for sophmore and heavier course work for senior. The first three students will have similar picture about light course work and the forth student will have a picture indicate heavy course work. The work experience part will be presented in list rather than a paragraph. With a obvious longer list on the forth students, the readers can easily sense that the senior have more work experience.

Difference between indoor and outdoor activities. The forth student enjoy the outdoor activities while the rest of the students enjoy indoor. The first three students will have the same background color and font. The background color and font should give the readers are sense of calm and peace, which nomally related to infoor activities. Teh forth one will use more active and energic color, which nomally related to outdoor activities. Also, under the extracurricular, a subtitle is added. It will say either a fan for indoor activities or a fan for outdoor activities for each individual. So that the reader will know what to expect when they look at the activies and clearly sense the difference between the first three and the forth.

### layout

For introduction page: The page will have a short introduction for four students and point out the difference between the first three and the forth clearly. This paragraph will have larger font and good padding, so that it easily catch the reader's sight and help the reader to get the main focus of the website. After the introduction section, there are short paragraphs for each students. The first three students will have the same background color and font and border. The forth one will have different kind of background color, font and border. The JS slider should have the picture of all four students. If the coder is capable of adding a frame for the pictures in the slider, it is recommended for the designer to have contrast frame color for the forth student. 

For individual page: The work experience, coursework and the picture for coursework will be on the left side and take around 70% of the space. The picture for the individual and extracurricular activities will be on the right side. The heading and the navigation bar should be in the center and have the same width as the body part.

In general, all the page should have nevigation bars. The nevigation bars should have links to all the pages except the thank you page(post_survey.php). All the pages should have idencial footer and similar design(but show contrast in the forth student webpage).

### suggestion for fonts

Details for fonts are mentioned above, in general the first students will have the same kind of fonts and the forth will have different kind of fonts. The fonts can be causual but not too funny. To better show the contradiction between the first three and the forth. On the introduction page, it is better the high light the keyword, like "prefer outdoor activities" or "have a lot of coursework".
