				<p>When I enrolled at the University of Rochester, I had planned on pursuing a double major in Computer Science and English. Because of this, my previous coursework is a pretty even mix of CSC and ENG courses. I've taken classes in acting, directing, dialect training, and in theatrical performance. On the computer science side, I've taken Data Structures and Algorithms, Formal Computation and Systems, and all the required math courses. This semester, I'm taking Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, my next step in the computer science track. I'm also taking Linear Algebra and Differential Equations, my first math class after calculus. I'm taking this class, and lastly I'm taking Musical Theatre Workshop, a course in preparing scenework and audition materials for musical theatre actors.</p>


				<h2>Hometown Info</h2>

				<p>I was born in Farmington, New York. Farmington is a town located in the northern part of Ontario County, New York, United States. The population was 11,825 at the 2010 census. Farmington is about twenty-five miles southeast of Rochester, New York. The town was formed along with its county in 1789. The town is governed by a town council, and the council's supervisor is Peter Ingalsbe.</p>
